2. Dataset 2 - This is the dataset used in the Roam blog post Prescription-based prediction. It is derived from a variety of US open health datasets, but the bulk of the data points come from the Medicare Part D dataset and the National Provider Identifier dataset.

The prescription vector for each doctor tells a rich story about that doctor's attributes, including specialty, gender, age, and region. There are 239,930 doctors in the dataset.
